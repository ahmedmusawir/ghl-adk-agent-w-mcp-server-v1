# Project Continuity System

## Session Management Protocol

### CRITICAL: Session File Management
1. **At the START of EVERY session:**
   - Check if a session file exists for today using format: `SESSION_[MONTH]_[DAY]_[YEAR]_SUMMARY.md`
   - Example: `SESSION_DEC_24_2025_SUMMARY.md`
   - If NO file exists for today → CREATE IT IMMEDIATELY
   - If file exists → READ IT to understand current project state

2. **During the session - UPDATE the session file after:**
   - Every code change or file modification
   - Important decisions or findings
   - Bug fixes or issues discovered
   - Architecture changes
   - Dependencies added/removed
   - ANY significant development

3. **Session File Structure:**
```md
# Session: [DATE]

## Project Status
- Current objective: [what we're working on]
- Last completed: [what was just finished]

## Code Changes
- [timestamp] - File: `path/to/file.ext` - Change: [description]

## Key Findings
- [Important discoveries, bugs found, solutions]

## Next Steps
- [ ] [What needs to be done next]

## Notes
- [Any other important context]
```

### MANDATORY BEHAVIOR
- **NEVER** skip creating/updating the session file
- **ALWAYS** update after significant work
- **RELIGIOUSLY** maintain this system - it's critical for project continuity
- When returning to a project, **IMMEDIATELY** read all session files chronologically

### On Project Switch
- Read all SESSION_*.md files to restore full context
- Start new session file for current date
- Reference previous session files when needed
